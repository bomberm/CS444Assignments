\section{Overview of Algorithm}
The focus of this algorithm is that a single philosopher can only pick up both forks at the same time. So the first part is establishing mutual exclusion with this action. This is implemented as a semaphore so only one philosopher can take the action of picking up both of the forks next to them. The second part of the algorithm is figuring out if you can pick up forks. This is implemented with the philosopher’s state. The three states are EAT, THINK, and HUNGRY. The purpose of EAT is so that the neighbors of the eater can identify the forks that are in use. THINK is the opposite, showing the forks are not in use. HUNGRY is used to make sure that each philosopher has a chance to eat. This places a philosopher in a state of ‘waiting’ for the forks. Because adjacent philosophers can be hungry at the same time the relinquishing of the forks depends on the hungry state of the neighbors. So a philosopher cannot begin to be hungry while its neighbor is hungry. This ensures that every philosopher will have a chance to eat.
\section{Testing}
We were able to verify our algorithm was functioning as intended by checking the action print outs of each philosopher. The philosophers were assigned in a specific order so if two adjacent philosophers ate simultaneously, we would see the error.
